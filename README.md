I am taking a class on Udemy to learn how to build A-Frame vr experinces.

I have a 360 camera and I want to make a virtual tour of a hike I did.

This is exactly what the teacher said to write, with the acception that I am using images while he was using 360 videos.

My first attempt making this scene in glitch did not work, the text entities could not be seen or used to change the scene.
Also glitch said my first animation for the camera look control had a special caracter that needed to be escaped (<)
